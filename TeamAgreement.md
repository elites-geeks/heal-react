# Team agreement

## Conflict Plan

Before starting the project, each member should explain any concerns or viewpoints they consider and want other members to respect.

Professional conflicts: If a conflict arises, each one has to end the discussion or the dialog immediately. Then other non-involved members will be notified about the issue, and they will be responsible for resolving it. Otherwise, the conflict will be escalated to the instructional team.

Personal disagreement: will be resolved away from other non-involved team members. It should not affect the workflow in any way. Members who persist in letting conflicts last will be reported to the instructors by the involved members without notifying other project members.

## Communication Plan

We will communicate throughout the Slack team channel. We also communicate through ZOOM meetings to work in pairs and for standup meetings. We will meet every day before standups with TAs and one after the lunch break and another by the end of the day.

Each team member during the standup meeting will utter their opinion. Other members will only listen to them without interruption or disagreement whatever they said after all members finished speaking. We will give each one the right to comment and discuss their thoughts about other people's ideas for only 5 minutes. Any conflict will be ended by the time all members finished their talks.

## Work Plan

We will use the provided Trello board to assign tasks. Each group member will work on their task until it is finished. Each one will be responsible for a certain task or component. When the functionality is ready, we will assign new tasks for another new one.

## Git Process

We will create a development branch that will be only for staging, and when the functionality is fully implemented and it is ready to go live, we will make a pull request to the main branch.

Each one, in the beginning, will be working on their tasks locally, then each one will push their work on a separate branch, and then they will make a pull request to the development branch.

One person is required to review the code, which will be pushed to the development branch. Two will be required to merge to the main branch.
